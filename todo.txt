todo:
attempt reroute ok VVVVVVVVVV

when unblock still take original path (no radio) vvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

stuck only on the node, not on road vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

counting the number of people that cant find the path vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
(fix unique people at location)

after that, test big file maybe? vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

filesaver put empty file in vvvvvvvvvvvvvv

do shape file (check note in phone) vvvvvvvvvv
and congest reroute? formula testing
COUNT times re-route strategy

strategy:
ONLY COMPUTE WHEN AGENT IS ON THE NODE. (is_on_node)
(do it at end of smart move, when overlaps node).
if not reroute, do as normal (val = 0)
if reroute (val = 1):
	+) agent will avoid the next congested road (next road on agent's shortest path) until it dies.
	+) agent will assume that the graph has no such road, and compute the shortest path
		- If it cant find the other shortest path, then it will go as normal, normal graph
		- If it can find the shortest path, go as that path, agent will have the graph of its own. (modified) => CHANGE IN USING TOPOLOGY
    DONE: vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
		
    
DONE: vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
modified graph has to change the same way as normal graph?
normal graph block a road => modified graph also needs to remove that blocked road
same case for unblocking action?
















CHANGE ROAD SO IT MATCHES FILE ATTRIBUTE FROM SHP!!!!

SCALE DOWN CAPACITY?
AVG LENGTH OF A CAR
AND LINK LENGTH 





import / export later (LATER!!!!!!!)
